# Security Policy

## Supported versions

We support the latest release and the `main` branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security reports.
Instead, open a private GitHub Security Advisory in this repository with steps to reproduce.
We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and work on a fix.
