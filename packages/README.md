# Packages

This directory contains the AgentConnect packages:

- `cli` for the host and registry tooling
- `host` for embedded host runtime + provider adapters
- `sdk` for the TypeScript SDK
- `ui` for reusable Web Components

App developers should consume published packages and avoid editing SDK code directly.
